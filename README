This repository's CI will daily broadcast snaps branches soon to expire in
Mattermost's ~desktop-team-eng channel. If the snap will expire in the
following day, it will itself refresh the channel without human intervention.

As the Snap Store considers that information is private data, to enroll
your snaps here, you first need to gather authorization data.

The recipe to enroll your snaps is:

* Locally, "snap install surl".
* Locally,

    surl -e {your@snapstore.email} -p package_release -p package_access \
         -s production --snap {snap} -a {snap}

  You will be asked your password and 2FA.
  This causes your authentication identifier file {auth-file}.surl, used in next
  step, to be created.
  You can opt-out of the "refresh without human intervention" part of this
  automation by not giving "-p package_release".
* Copy the contents of ~/snap/surl/common/{auth-file}.surl to a new repository
  secret in https://github.com/canonical/snap-expire/settings/secrets/actions.
* Add your env and printf lines to .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
* Append your entry to watched-snaps, whose format is

  {snap} {expire-in} {auth-file} [{mattermost-ids}]

  {expire-in}: Your snap (and optionally mattermost-ids for pinging) will be
               included in the Mattermost's reminder message if a branch of it
               will expire in {expire-in} days.
  {mattermost-ids}: List of Mattermost IDs to ping (separated by whatever
                    punctuation, but not spaces, e.g. person1:person2,person3).

* Yes, I do regret writing this as a shell script. Passing around text is no fun.
